# Introduction

ChezaLink aims to bridge the visibility gap between youth athletes and
professional scouts, by offering a digital platform where young players
can showcase their talent, track their stats, and access exposure
opportunities. This report outlines our findings from interviews and
questionnaires conducted with coaches, scouts, youth athletes and other
stakeholders in Kenyan grassroots and semi-professional sports.

# Objective of Research

To understand the pain points, needs, and opportunities within the youth
sports ecosystem in Kenya and to validate the market demand for a
platform like ChezaLink.

# Methodology

Interviews Conducted with:

- Coaches (Grassroots to University level)

- Scouts and Talent Developers

  Questionnaire Distribution to:

- Young athletes

# Key Interview Insights

## Aggrey Ongoli:

U11 TEAM - Soka Talent located at Kenya Science, Ngong Road, Nairobi  
U20 & U23 TEAM - Team Umeme in Ziwani estate  
  
Pain points:

- Lack of sponsors and funding leads to inadequate training facilities
  (balls, cones, bibs).

- Stats are recorded manually on paper hence difficult to track progress
  consistently.

- Poor facilities deter scouts from attending matches hence less player
  exposure.

Quote: "ChezaLink could help digitize stats and attract more attention
to these players from scouts"

## Coach K:

- Football and Basketball coach at JKUAT Karen campus.

- His team participates in University leagues and tournaments.

  Observations

- Thinks it will help many young players gain exposure and keep track of
  their progress and stats.

- Advises that we should pitch this idea to the university league and
  tournaments.

  Quote: "You should pitch this to varsity sports organizers to digitize
  tournament data and highlight talent."

## Titus Mulama:

- Scout/Youth talent developer

- Former Harambee stars midfielder (2001--2012)

  Perspective

- Thinks ChezaLink would help local football federations keep track of
  player data across multiple levels from the youth scene to semi-pro
  and pro level.

  Quote: "ChezaLink could be a powerful tool for federations and scouts
  to monitor players across different levels."

# Questionnaire Highlights

Respondents: 4  
  
Key Stats:

- 50% said that they have never recorded their stats

digital stats profile for many of them.

| Player stat tracking     | Manual paper records        | Mobile-friendly digital tracking                           |
| Exposure to scouts       | Limited to in-person visits | Video uploads + verified profiles                          |
| Tournament visibility    | Poor coverage               | Partner with local leagues/tournament hosts to track games |
| Infrastructure access    | Underfunded                 | Offer platform as a value-add to attract sponsors          |
| National federation data | Fragmented                  | Aggregate career stats from grassroots to pro              |

# Conclusion

The findings from both interviews and surveys strongly validate the need
for ChezaLink. The grassroots and university-level sports scenes are
under-served in terms of digital tools, and both coaches and scouts are
open to solutions that can improve player visibility, performance
tracking, and data integrity.
